## Instructions on running recommendation code

The processes below assume that your database is on your localhost. The database schema is the same as in the **capstone-MM-DD-YYYY.sql** file.

The recommendation algorithm is written in **Python 2.7**. Please execute them in **Python2 environment**.

The recommendation algorithm requires the installation of libraries below:
**MySQLdb, numpy, pandas, itertools, sklearn, scipy, re, csv**

1. Run ``preprocess.py`` to calculate score data and write back the score table to the database.
  * Please replace the parameters **host**, **user**, **passwd** and **db** in line 22 and 85 with your own information.
  * After executing this file, please wait until the console prints Done. The message printed looks like this:
```
Start...
Done.
```

2. Run ``DataReader.py`` to interact with MySQL database.
  * Please replace the parameters **host**, **user**, **passwd** and **db** with your own information.

3. Run ``EnsembleRecommender.py`` to generate personalized recommendations for each user.
  * Please note that this file takes about **20 mins** to run and is expected to take more time when the number of users and technologies increase in the database. After running the file, you should be able to see the message below:

```
  * After the code finishes running, it writes back a ``recommendationresultforusers`` table back to MySQL database. By default, we are generating 10 recommendations for each user. If you want to configure the number of recommendations, please change the number 10 in line 251 to the number of recommendations you want to generate and rerun the file.

  * You can check the recommendation table by executing
```sql
select * from recommendationresultforusers;
```

4. Run ``EnsembleRecommenderForTechnology.py`` to generate similar technologies for a given technology.
After running the file, you should be able to see the message below:
```
Start building tech keyword sim matrix...
Done.

Start building item_based Collaborative Filtering sim matrix...
Done.

Start building Ensemble sim matrix...
Done.

Start writing recommendations to the database...
Done
```
  * After the code running completes, it writes back a ``recommendationresultfortechs`` table back to MySQL database. By default, we are generating 10 recommendations for each technology. If you want to configure the number of recommendations, please change the number 10 in line 146 to the number of recommendations you want to generate and rerun the code.

  * You can check the recommendation table by executing
```sql
select * from recommendationresultfortechs;
```

## Instructions on accessing dashboard
The processes below assume that your database is on your localhost. The database schema is the same as in the **capstone-MM-DD-YYYY.sql** file.

We are using **Pyramid** web framework under **Python 2.7**. Please install Pyramid by executing:
```
pip install "pyramid==1.8.3"
```

1. Navigate to ``../MSIM_capstone/visualization/visualization``. Open ``DataReaderViz.py`` and replace the parameters **host**, **user**, **passwd** and **db** in line 9 with your own information.

2. Change your working directory to ``../MSIM_capstone/visualization``.

3. If you are first time user, run the code below in terminal. Make sure you are under **Python2 environment**. If you are not first time user, feel free to skip this step.
```
python setup.py develop
```


4. Run the code below to setup local host.
```
pserve development.ini
```

5. Open browser and enter the url below to access dashboards:
  * If you are trying to access graphs for **an university** with specific university_id, use the URL below
  ```
  http://localhost:6543/university/university_id
  ```
  * If you want to access **all universities level** graphs, use the URL below:
  ```
